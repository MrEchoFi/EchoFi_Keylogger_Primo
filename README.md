# Note: 
<pre>
     this keylogger contains ducky script and by using ducky script or create ducky script, anyone can inject or install malware in victims device. 
 Btw this is a python file based keylogger . if u want to experience in real life by phishing then u can turn this python based keylogger file into exe file. But test this in lab environment with real authorization.

//  i m using a example of ducky script to show you how it works! || you can change the ducky scripts. if u want to know how to write your own new custom ducky                 scripts then knock me in this---> tanjibisham777@gmail.com
